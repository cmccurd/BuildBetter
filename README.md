### General Info
This app will support players in making thier decks with explicit tags designed to make a cohesive deck. Players will be warned when they are going over the limit in specific catagories. 

## Problem ##
  > Most casual commander players don't know what direction to take when developing a cohesive deck. This can be a problem because they will tend to focus on cards that enhance their commander over staple card catagories needed in every commander deck. EX. Player doesn't put enough card draw in his deck, another player board wipes. Now the first player has no way to get cards and replenish their board they are essentially out of the game because they built an unbalanced deck.
  
## Solution ##
  > By giving general guidelines to the players it will ensure the deck has consistancy while playing. Consistancy with card draw and always having creatures, board-wipes, or instant speed removal will keep the player active in the game. This will hopefully support a player like the guard rails in a bowling alley.

## Customer Quote ##
  > I was always losing to my friends when we played commander, but ever since I started using the guidelines BuildBetter gave me I have been consitantly placing first or second.
