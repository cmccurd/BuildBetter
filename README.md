There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > BuildBetter

## Sub-Heading ##
  > This is an app to support a Magic The Gathering commander player.

## Summary ##
  > This app will support players in making thier decks with explicit tags designed to make a cohesive deck. Players will be warned when they are going over the limit in specific catagories. 

## Problem ##
  > Most casual commander players don't know what direction to take when developing a cohesive deck. This can be a problem because they will tend to focus on cards that enhance their commander over staple card catagories needed in every commander deck. EX. Player doesn't put enough card draw in his deck, another player board wipes. Now the first player has no way to get cards and replenish their board they are essentially out of the game because they built an unbalanced deck.
  
## Solution ##
  > By giving general guidelines to the players it will ensure the deck has consistancy while playing. Consistancy with card draw and always having creatures, board-wipes, or instant speed removal will keep the player active in the game. This will hopefully support a player like the guard rails in a bowling alley.

## Quote from You ##
  > Our goal is to get you the tips needed to play Better Magic.

## How to Get Started ##
  > If you have a deck already, import it and our lightwieght app will save the deck and allow users to start catagorizing.

## Customer Quote ##
  > I was always losing to my friends when we played commander, but ever since I started using the guidelines BuildBetter gave me I have been consitantly placing first or second.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > After you make your deck try out our playtesting sim.
